# Quiz-me: A memory reinforcement applicaton

## How to install and run
1. clone the repo
1. create a virtual environment using pipenv, e.g.,

        $ pipenv install
    or create a virtualenv using mkvirtualenv, e.g.,

        $ mkvirtualenv quizme

1. activate the virtualenv, e.g.,

        $ pipenv shell
    or using virtualenv:

        $ workon quizme
1. If using virtualenv instead of pipenv, install the required packages in the virtualenv, e.g.,

        $ pip install --requirement requirements.txt
1. install and run postgresql (if using postgresql); e.g., on OSX,

        $ brew install postgresql (or "brew update")
    (`brew info postgresql` to see how to start/stop)
    (if errors, consider `brew reinstall postgresql`)
1. start postgres; e.g., on OSX,

        $ launchctl list | grep postgres  # see if launchctl knows about postgres, and if so, what the last exit status is

        $ brew services list  # list all running services, and see if postgresql is there
        $ brew services stop postgresql
1. create a postgres database, e.g.,

        $ createdb quizme
    (note that the database name "quizme" is a setting in `settings.py` for
     `DATABASES['default']['NAME']`
    )
1. create a postgres user:

        $ createuser quizme
    --or--

        $ psql --command="CREATE USER quizme"

    Test it:

        $ psql --user=quizme quizme
1. load existing data into database, or start with an empty database:

        $ DB_QUIZME=my_db_name ./manage.py syncdb
        $ DB_QUIZME=my_db_name ./manage.py migrate
1. create a superuser

        $ DB_QUIZME=my_db_name ./manage.py createsuperuser --email my_user@my_domain.com

## How to run tests

1. Install phantomjs: `brew cask install phantomjs`
2. Install geckodriver: `brew install geckodriver`
3. Install Firefox

### Docker Test Environment
I got some docker containers setup for with the intent of making local testing easier. In order to use it, you need to install docker and docker-compose, which is a util for managing sets of docker containers.

There are two config files involved with the docker testing containers:

```
Dockerfile
docker-compose.yml
```

The Django database settings also need to be modified. The best way to do that is by adding a `local_settings.py` file to the project's root directory with the following content:
```
DATABASES = {
'default': {
    'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
    'NAME': 'postgres',
    'USER': 'postgres',
    'HOST': 'db',
    'PORT': 5432,
    }
}
```

In order to get docker running the following commands need to be run from this project's root directory:

```
$ docker-compose up
$ docker-compose run web DB_QUIZME=my_db_name python manage.py syncdb
$ docker-compose run web DB_QUIZME=my_db_name python manage.py migrate
```

Django, Docker, and Pdb don't play well together. In order to set a stack trace inside some app code run docker-compose like so:

```
$ docker-compose run --service-ports web
```

I'm far from an expert on Docker in particular or containers in general. If something happens with a container and I don't know how to fix it I go nuclear, and then recreate everything. This command will stop and remove all containers.
```
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

## Development Conventions and Process

* **merge commits**  
  All branch merges must have a merge commit (to make it clear when the branch changed), as opposed to a rebase, where there's no record of the rebase in git history.
* **merge commit message details**  
    * The following labels should be used to indicate what the commit does:  
        * *CHANGE*
        * *COMMENT*
        * *FIX*
        * *NEW*
        * *REFACTOR*
    * For *CHANGE* commits, the message must include:
        * *OLD BEHAVIOR*:
        * *NEW BEHAVIOR*:
    * For *FIX* commits, the message must include:
        * *ISSUE* (include what the user sees, error text, etc.)
        * *FIX* (what the fix is)
        * *BEHAVIOR* (what the change in behavior is)
    * For *NEW* commits, the message must include:
        * *BEHAVIOR*: what difference in behavior the user will see
    * Note that *BEHAVIOR* descriptions should minimally be from the user's point of view (and optionally from the developer's point of view)
* **manual testing for PR** -- each branch to be merged must have all manual tests run
* **manual test log**  -- manual testing for each branch or commit must be logged in TESTING.md
* **PEP8**  --code style must adhere to PEP8; PEP8 diversions are specified in tox.ini
* **granular commits**  
  All commits should be granular, e.g., a single (CHANGE, COMMENT, FIX, NEW, REFACTOR).  
  e.g., a single commit should not contain both fixes and features.
* **view &ast;.md changes before merging**   
  If changes are made to a markdown file (e.g., README.md), those changes should be viewed in a markdown editor (preferably github) before merging, to confirm that the formatting is correct.  `grip` (`brew install grip`) is a good utility for doing this.
* **update README.md**
  Update README.md accordingly, including:  
    * TODO section -- remove corresponding item(s) if they have been implemented in this commit

## Thoughts about scheduling
* maybe capture percentage of correctness and time since last seen
* I ask myself: when do I want to see this again?
* I ask myself: how long before I think I will forget this?
* consider assigning an importance to each question; distinguish between how important it is to me, and when I think I will forget it; don't mix the two together

## Show schedules for each tag

User > QuestionTag's > Question's > Schedule's > Schedule.date_added

Want: most recently-added Schedule for each Question for the specified User
To get latest Schedule's, need Question's and User
To get Question's, need QuestionTags -- need tags and user

Reference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27544223/django-query-filter-many-to-many-to-many-etc
Reference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3630619/django-queryset-for-many-to-many-field

Data structure to process schedules:
  questions2schedules[question_id] == latest_schedule

Iterate through questions for each tag:
    for tag in tags:
        questions = ...
        questions.annotate(newest_date_added)
        for question in questions:
            tag2periods...

Resulting data structure:
```
  tag2periods['python']['now-10m'] = 4
              ^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^    ^
              tag       period       num_questions
```

Consider using the Max(pk) to get the latest-added schedule.

Note that a question with multiple tags will still only have one schedule, because the schedule is per user per question.

Q: How do I find the most-recently-added schedule of each question (datetime_added)?
A: I have the queryset of questions.
*Get the code working first, then worry about performance.  Easier to just ask on stackoverflow with existing code.*

## Glossary / Terms / Nomenclature

**Table names**

* *answer* - answers to questions
* *attempt* -
    one question can have many attempts per user<br><br>

    fields:
        attempt.datetime_added - added, added_ts, when, when_added, ts_added, dt_added, *created

        attempt.datetime_updated - when_updated, *updated
        attempt.attempt
        attempt.text - the text the user typed in;
            body; corpus; paragraph; clob; stanza; input; representation

    brainstorming alternative names:
        trial?
        answer?
        given_answer?  user_answer (vs correct_answer)
        in_answer (incoming answer)
* *hint* - a hint for a question toward the answer
* *ignore* - ignore a question; never show it (alternative: hide)
* *question* - a question table
* *questiontag* - question id, get a representation of tags; junction table;
    one-to-many; find out what tags a given question has
* *quiz* - a set of tags, number of questions, options, ...
* *quiztag* - many-to-many; quiz_id, tag_id
* *?review? (verb)* - term for the act of using the program, of quizzing oneself, of reviewing flashcards
* *schedule* - for a question, the next time to ask that question again

    Alternatives:
        next_time_to_ask
        future
        when
        ask_again_time / ts / date / datetime
        appointment / future_appointment
        scheduled_at
        feedback
        output
        response
        Could response and schedule go together in the same table?
        interval_unit -- interval_value, interval

* *tag* - an arbitrary symbol associated with a question

TODO: see if tables can be renamed in Django (eliminate the "questions_" prefix)

**Initial Glossary**
* answer - the "correct" answer associated with a question; a question can have 0 or 1 answers
* attempt - a user's single attempt to answer a question; it is the user's guess as to the answer
* hint - a hint for a question and answer (not yet implemented)
* schedule - when the user wants to see a question again
* question - a question
* quiz - a set of associated questions (not yet implemented)
* quiz - the name of the main Django app
* tag - a tag associated with a question; a question can have 0 to many tags
* user tag - the tags that a user has selected indicating which questions they want to see

## Tests
Tests to add:
* 12/27/14 add a test where there are no questions for whatever tags are selected, but selecting a different tag causes a question to be shown

## Notes
QuizMe notes can be found in these places:
* here (git repo /README)
* notebooks
* Portland Python quiz program (~/bin/learn/quiz.python/quiz.py)

*The rest of this file was moved from bin/learn/quiz.python/db/db_app_designs 9/16/13*

## Documentation on various topics
question_next - ready (just a redirect to question)
question - shows a question with a form to input an attempt
    GET - show the question and an empty for for an attempt
    POST - post a new attempt
answer - shows the question, attempt, and answer, and a form to input a schedule
    GET - show the question, attempt, and answer
    POST - create a new schedule; redirect to question_next

Start request|Start template|User Action                           |End Request        |End template
-------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------
(none)       |(none)        |user goes into quiz for the first time|GET /show_question/|show_question.html

GET /show_question/  show_question.html             user answers a question POST /show_question/  show_question_and_answer.html
POST /show_question/ show_question_and_answer.html  user clicks             GET /show_question/   show_question.html

### Requests, methods, and templates:
METHOD|REQUEST   |TEMPLATE REQUEST IS FROM  REQUEST VIA
------|----------|--------------------------------------------
GET   |/question/|question.html
POST  |/question/| 

### Symbolic actions:
* ask/show question (GET question)
* submit answer (POST question) (really POSTing an attempt)
* schedule question for next time (GET answer) (really GETting a specific attempt along with answer)
* submit answer feedback (POST answer) (really POSTing a schedule)

### Algorithm for deciding which question to show next:
* question has no schedule
* question has schedule with no interval

### Time Zones
`USE_TZ = True` in the settings.py file, so time zone support is enabled.  Times are stored as UTC.  
To get the current time in UTC, use:

    from django.utils import timezone
    now = timezone.now()
Note that:

    >>> naive = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
    >>> aware = timezone.now()
utcnow() is naive.

*See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/i18n/timezones/*

### How to backup Postgres database and restore
Q: How to make a backup of the database?  
A:   
`make dumpdb`  
This creates dumps in 2 different formats (plain and custom) and puts them in the db_dumps subdir with a datestamp on them, e.g.,

```
-rw-r--r--  1 rob  staff  244938 Sep 26 17:26 dump.quizme.2014.09.26_Fri_17.26.21.plain
-rw-r--r--  1 rob  staff  125248 Sep 26 17:26 dump.quizme.2014.09.26_Fri_17.26.21.custom
```

Q: How to restore from a backup?  
A: 
`make loaddb`

This will create two databases named "restore_quizme_custom" and "restore_quizme_plain" and load the dumps.  They should each be identical, as the plain and custom dumps should each have the same data.

Q: How to restore a database manually?  
A:

```
DB_NAME_RESTORE_CUSTOM=restore_quizme_custom
FILE_DUMP_CUSTOM=~/Dropbox/git/quizme_website/db_dumps/dump.quizme.2016.09.04_Sun_10.01.32.custom
psql --dbname=postgres --command="DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS ${DB_NAME_RESTORE_CUSTOM}"
psql --dbname=postgres --command="CREATE DATABASE ${DB_NAME_RESTORE_CUSTOM}"
# Create role (what does it need to be?)
psql --dbname=postgres --command="CREATE USER rob"
pg_restore --verbose --dbname=${DB_NAME_RESTORE_CUSTOM} ${FILE_DUMP_CUSTOM} >& /tmp/pg_restore.out
psql --dbname=postgres --command="ALTER DATABASE ${DB_NAME_RESTORE_CUSTOM} RENAME TO quizme_master"
```
To get webapp to connect to that db:

```
    quizme_website/settings.py
        DATABASES
            'NAME': 'restore_quizme_custom'
```

## #TODO / #Backlog / #Features / #Stories
(NOTE: deprecate the Trello board and move the backlog items from https://trello.com/b/5WCzHwdo/quizme to here)

* 12.29.21  FEATURE  show times of recent flashcards answered / marked seen (e.g., 10:05pm, 10:07pm, 10:15pm)
* 12.29.21  FEATURE  import Anki decks
* 7.14.20 COMMENT README cleanup (get rid of Naming Ideas; check formatting; proofread whole file)
* 7.14.20 REFACTOR See if emailusername can be eliminated
* 7.14.20 UPGRADE See if I can easily move my quizme_product db data into a fresh db
* 7.12.20 BUG If there is no valid session, when going to /login/?next=/question/ , it gives a 404 error instead of going to the login screen (this seems to happen when switching between databases, I don't know why).  WORKAROUND: navigate to the /admin page, it will prompt for login, login, and then you can access the question page
* 7.12.20 FEATURE consider a "frequency" field to indicate how often to see the flashcard (why? to show important/frequent cards that I want to see often, like daily, before other cards that are waiting to be seen before now) (e.g., show this card every 1 days, and if it hasn't been seen in the last day, then show it before other cards)
* 7.12.20 DEV_PROCESS update the release process to use github "releases" (why? to see release history, and see what was added when) (e.g., https://github.com/timmyomahony/django-pagedown/releases)
* 7.12.20 FEATURE prefill interval with values from previous schedule (why? to save time when reviewing)
* 7.12.20 FEATURE order by questions with answers first (why? to practice one's being learned)
* 7.12.20 FEATURE order by interval secs (amount of time scheduled to be seen again) (why? to practice what I am actively learning)
* 7/4/20, 3/28/15 allow a tree structure of tags, so that selecting a tag would select that and everything below it [suggested by Nev] (I discovered that I'm not reviewing as many flashcards because of not having this; e.g., select all non-software tags)
* 7/4/20 FEATURE: add db name to each web page
* 7/4/20 FEATURE: make question and answer editable while quizzing
* 7/4/20 FEATURE: optionally sort tags by date added, or just show the date added
* 6/24/20 FEATURE: when outputting dates, add the day-of-the-week, e.g. *__Tue__ June 23, 2020, 3:42 a.m.*
* 6/24/20 FEATURE: add *time_since_last_seen* field to schedule, e.g., the amount of time (secs, and maybe human-readable, and maybe previous date seen) between this response and the last response
* 6/24/20 FEATURE: add option to sort questions by number of times answered
* 6/24/20 FEATURE: put question and response in a single page, with the answer collapsed
* 6/24/20 FEATURE: show questions ordered by importance
* 6/24/20 FEATURE: add option to show unanswered questions first/last
* 6/24/20 FEATURE: add favorite or "like" percentage value for responses; similar to importance, but more for enjoyment of the question; add option to show questions sorted by "like"
* 9/14/16 STYLE: in list of tags, change the color of the tag if the tag is selected, to make it clear which are selected
* 9/11/16 FEATURE: For the selected tags, show them one per line right under "Tags selected:", along with num_questions and time periods, as is shown in the next section with all the tags.  As a user, I want to see these tags at the top and not have to hunt for them.
* 9/7/16 MODIFY: in the admin, modify it so that the width of the question/answer text isn't a single line and extremely wide
* 9/5/16 FEATURE: save the duration/interval to attempt table in the database; then show this duration for the answer, so the user can determine how well they did for the actual interval compared to the desired interval; also, consider adding query criteria for a quiz to say "show me all questions with an interval of less than 2 days"
* 9/5/16 FEATURE: for a quiz, make it possible to exclude questions with specified tags (e.g., quiz with all 'python' tags, except for questions that also contain the page 'web pages to review')
* 9/5/16 TEST: add tests for:
    - num_questions (for each tag)
    - each interval:
        - -now
        - 10m-1h
        - 1h-1d
        - 1d-1w
        - 1w-1mo
        - 1mo-1y
        - unseen
* 7/1/15 FEATURE: in addition to tags, consider keywords
* 6/28/15 FEATURE: show how long (duration/interval) it has been between when we last answered the question and now; this will me when I answer determine how long I want to set the next interval (both question and answer pages)
* 6/2/15 BUG: I added a new question with tags=[file_systems, unix]; when I went to quiz myself with a bunch of tags selected, but neither [file_systems, unix], I still got that question; after I answered that question, I then got another question with those same tags
  - it might be because the schedules query 
  - questions being shown that should not be:
        http://localhost:8000/question/1052/  
        http://localhost:8000/question/1053/
* 5/29/15 show list of selected tags on one line (instead of having to look through list of all tags) #high
* 05/17/15 show the number of questions recently answered/scheduled (e.g., 0-10mins=[5]  10-30mins=[12] 30m-2h=[4]  0-2h=[21])  #high
* 04/03/15 add a "note" section to the schedule, as a scratchpad, and also to mention what I forgot and what to remember next time  #high
* 3/10/15 don't allow duplicate tags to be created
* 3/10/15 show the question number on the answer page, so that it can be visually seen to manually edit the question in the admin
* Export (export questions via csv / json / yaml / xml / python data structure / plain text).  Find a way to maintain referential integrity.
* 02/11/15 On the answer page, add an input box where the user can type to practice the answer.  Maybe or maybe not save it (only value in saving it would be to see the effort that was made).  #high
* 01/23/15 Django Admin: be able to click on the answer from the list of questions page.
* 02/15/15 Django Admin: show the associated question(s) for each answer, and be able to click on the question 
* 01/23/15 Django Admin: add ability to edit answer in same page as editing question.
* 2/11/15  Show the schedule numbers for the total of selected tags (just like is done for each individual tag)  #high
* 01/23/15 Add search to Django admin to search in questions and answers.
* 12/31/14 Added schedule intervals for "immediate" and "never"
* 12/31/14 Allow a quiz mode that consists of a set of questions, and the user can go back and change their answers as much as they want (e.g., as part of an interview)
* 12/31/14 Make it possible to view questions that don't have any tags ("untagged")  #high
* 12/31/14 Have a "review all" mode that goes through all questions for the selected tags, showing you number seen and number remaining.
* 12/31/14 REFACTOR: change all datetime_* variables to either date_* or time_\*
* 12/31/14 Change all timezones to UTC
* 12/30/14 Implement variations (a question can have variations -- other questions that are similar but modified in a different way; e.g., 2+3=? could be a variation of 2+2=?); this is helpful so that you don't get in the habit of seeing the question and remembering the answer without understanding it
* 12/27/14 ask how well the question was answered (maybe percentage; excellent / good / bad)
* 12/21/14 Modify to pass question number in endpoint instead of as hidden field
* 12/21/14 Add contributors.md
* 12/21/14 Add to readthedocs
* 02/15/15 Consider adding a priority field (interval is ideally when you want to see it again, but priority is how important it is to you; so 2 different questions could have the same interval, but the one with the higher priority gets shown first; however, what to do if question1 has interval 1 month and priority "high", and question2 has interval 1 minute and priority "low" -- which gets shown first?)
* 12/21/14 Add tasks to either github issues or to Trello
* 11/17/14 add ability to select all or deselect all for tags  #high
* 10/20/14 add search ability, to search questions/answers for specified keywords
* 10/20/14 in the admin, when viewing a question, show the answer as an inline that can also be edited; likewise, when viewing an answer, show the question inline  #high
* 10/20/14 in the admin, when viewing a question, add a link/url to jump to the answer to view/edit it  #high
* 10/19/14 upgrade Django to latest (currently using 1.6.7; latest is 1.7)
* 10/18/14 per Steven Jonas, have a way to find other questions (or bookmarked webpages) with similar content to help form associations and new insights
* 10/18/14 have questions that are a single webpagge to review (a url), and show the content of the webpage instead of just a link
* 8/17/14 enabling tags during an answer does not enable it when the next question is shown (but it does work if enabled when asking a question)
* BUG: clicking on tag (to disable) during a question does not disable it when the answer is shown
* Show linefeeds as linefeeds for questions/answers/attempts (add <br/> tags; or add a rich text editor)
* 7/15/14 - add admin "list_filter" setting to be able to filter by tags on questions and answers
* use a single template: combine show_question.html and show_question_and_answer.html
* add an inline in the admin to edit the answer for a given question
* ability to change tags for the question shown #high

    - `** Programming`
    - `**** Languages`
    - `****** Python`
    - `****** Perl`
    - `****** C`
    - `** Methodologies`
    - `**** Agile`
    - (maybe allow multiple parent/child relationships)

    * page to create account
    * email address verification/registration
* tests
* Footer: 
    * show tags
    * show how many times seen
    * show how many times answered
    * show last time seen
